### Configure OpenAI

To enable AI-powered image generation, configure the OpenAI provider:

1. Create an API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
2. Store the API key securely in `private://keys/openai_provider.key`.
3. Ensure the key is deployed in your hosting environment to be accessible.

image generation option. OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E model will generate images based on
input prompts.

For bulk image creation and media automation, additional configurations can be
applied via the AI module settings under **Admin > Configuration > Media**.
